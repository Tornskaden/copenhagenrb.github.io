# Copenhagen Ruby Brigade Website

A simple Jekyll based website for the [Copenhagen Ruby Brigade](http://www.copenhagenrb.dk).

Built with a few goals:

1. Easy maintainance - even for developers not usually doing web development.
2. Easy deployment - preferring solid hosting over dynamic features.

## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator, built in Ruby, supported by GitHub. For information getting Jekyll up and running, check out http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/.
